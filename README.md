# Neemans-Class
This is where we share files for collaboration on programming projects.
##First project will be the Unit 10 Lab. 
  <p>    Write an applet program that demonstrates composition and inheritance. These concepts need to be shown in graphics format similar to the Tree examples from chapter 10. Two other examples are shown below: In the case of the Jack-O’-lantern, a Jack O’-lantern is-a Pumpkin, and a Jack-O’- lantern has-a Face. In the case of a Train, a Train has-a Locomotive, TrainCars, and a Caboose; however, a Locomotive is-a TrainCar that has-a Funnel and a Scoop. A Caboose is-a red TrainCar that has Windows and a Cupola (the thing on the top).</p>
  <p>    Your program needs to demonstrate two example of inheritance and two examples of composition. This will mean a minimum of three separate classes, besides the testing class. You must be aware that the Java syntax has to follow the rules of composition and inheritance. In other words you cannot simply declare some classes that have the required properties in real life. For instance an Animal has-a Head and a Tiger is-an Animal. That is fine, but the Java program statements must correctly use the relationships.</p>
